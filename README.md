# Aggron Intel
Aggron is a tool used to gather customer data for restaurants from aggregators. Currently works with Zomato and Smiles. It gathers the information, processes it into usable form, which is then stored in a Google Sheets dashboard. Aggregators are often very stingy with their order data, and oftentimes restaurants are unable to get this invaluable information. Aggron helps them to do so - past successes include helping one dine-in restaurant increase its online delivery sales by 25%, and another delivery concept to shift from a loss-making operation to a monthly ~10,000 AED profitable operation, by enabling restaurants to directly reach out to their own customers outside of aggregator platforms.

An Aggron dashboard looks like this:

I did not proceed with this idea further because of the difficulty in convincing restaurant partners of its viability and making this a paid product. While order data and insights are very actionable, the final call depends upon the restaurant management themselves, which results in varied results and experiences. While the product has been shelved for now, existing customers are still supported as and when requested.
