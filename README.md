# Aggron Intel
Aggron is a tool used to gather customer data for restaurants from aggregators. It gathers aggregator order information, processes it into usable form, which is then stored in a Google Sheets dashboard. Aggregators are often very stingy with their order data, and oftentimes restaurants are unable to get this invaluable information. Aggron helps them to do so - past successes include helping one dine-in restaurant increase its online delivery sales by 25%, and another delivery concept to shift from a loss-making operation to a monthly ~$5,000 profitable operation, by enabling restaurants to directly reach out to their own customers outside of aggregator platforms.

An Aggron dashboard looks like this:
